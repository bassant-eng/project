<h1>The global warming</h1>
<p><b>Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, cloud forests are dying, and wildlife is scrambling to keep pace.</p><p> It has become clear that humans have caused most of the past century's warming by releasing heat-trapping gases as we power our modern lives.</b></p>
<p><b>Climate change is causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate</b></p>
<p><b> scientists use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.</b></p>
<p><em>What will we do—what can we do—to slow this human-caused warming?<br> How will we cope with the changes we've already set into motion?</em></p>
